_________________________________________

The ClearCase::CtCmd module requires that ClearCase be installed:

Platform			ClearCase Version
_________________________________________

Solaris 2.7,2.8			4.1 or greater
RH Linux 6.2,7.0,7.1,7.2	4.1 "  "
HPUX 10.20,11.00		4.1  "  "
Windows NT 4.0,5.0		4.2  "  "
AIX 5.1,5.0,4.3	        	4.1  "  "



__________________________________________

Build and Install
__________________________________________

Build and installation is by the usual method:

perl Makefile.PL 
make
make test
make install


For verbose output when making test, set environment 
variable TEST_VERBOSE=1 and run "make -e test".

"make LIB=/<install path>" may be useful for testing "make install".

Note:  The CC class is for test purposes only, although it
may be consulted for an indication of how ClearCase::CtCmd may be used.

When the MVFS is not installed, e. g. with ClearCase LT, it is not possible
to "make test".  However, in most cases, passing directly from a 
successful "make" to "make install" will be satisfactory.

__________________________________________

Platform Notes
__________________________________________

Unix/Linux:

Set environment variable ATRIA_ROOT to the  
path to the ClearCase installation if different from /usr/atria:  
Linked install:  set ATRIA_ROOT to network path.

If /var/tmp is not available, set environment variable CC_CTCMD_TMP
to the path of an altrnative directory.


Solaris:

It is not possible to run ClearCase::CtCmd under Solaris 2.5.1/2.6 
without setting environment variable LD_PRELOAD to /usr/ucblib/librpcsoc.so.
Modify Makefile.PL accordingly if you must try this.

If the wrong perl interpreter or C compiler is found

ln -s <path to Perl> perl; ln -s <path to cc> cc,
or add the paths to those programs to PATH.

If using Solaris 5.8 /usr/bin/perl and trying to build the Module with gcc,
Set environment variable CC_CTCMD_GCC=<any non null value>.  This might work
with other Solaris Perls/gcc, as well. 

HPUX:

The Module will build and install on HPUX-10.20 and HPUX-11.0 
as long as Perl has been built on the respective system.  In other words,
If Perl is built on HPUX-10.20, the Module cannot be built on HPUX-11.0,
and vice-versa.  The reason for this restriction has to do with thread
safe libc's.  Symbol __pthread_create_system, needed by certain of the 
HPUX-11 ClearCase shared libraries ,  is found in libc.2, but not
in libc.1 (HPUX-10.20).  Perl, when built on HPUX-11, depends on libc.2.
A dependency on libc.2 cannot be built into the Module becasue of the 
restriction on using shl_load() to load a library containing __thread symbols.

Linux:

Note that is impossible to mount more than 127 VOBs on Linux, and if that
number or close to it is mounted "make test" may fail when trying to
create and mount a VOB.

Win32:

Substitute "nmake" for "make" when building and installing.

There must be an environment variable: 
TMP=<path to system temporary storage, full control by everyone>.

The path to Microsoft Visual Studio and to perl must be in the PATH.

The user must be able to run "perl", "cleartool", "cl" and "dumpbin"
from the command line without error messages before attempting
installation.  The environment variables "inc" and "lib" must be set to
the paths where the MS Visual Studio C include files and libraries are
kept.  The user's PATH must include the path to the MSDEV ...\common\bin
and ...\bin directories, as well as the path to cleartool and the Atria
*.dll's.  Perl, version 5.0004 or greater must be installed, and the
installed Perl must have the necessary header and other files to allow
installation of a Perl Module. 

If cmdsyn.lib or ks.lib is not being created it may be because the path to
"dumpbin" or the path to the Atria libraries is not in the user's PATH

An error message "This shared resource does not exist" at the beginning 
of t/t1_createArch when nmaking test indicates that a view previously mapped
then unmapped is inaccessible.  Pressing <enter> should allow the test
to continue.

Setting AUTODEF_DEBUG=<any non null value> will produce debugging output to 
assist in determining if ks.lib and cmdsyn.lib are being produced correctly.

In case of "nmake test" failure to create test view: 
"System error 67 - The network name cannot be found":

If the default view net name, "view", has been set to some other value with registry key 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE:SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Mvfs\Parameters\view_netname, 
set environment variable CC_VIEW_NETNAME=\\<view net name>\ before running 
"nmake test", or running the tests in directory t explicitly. For example,

set CC_VIEW_NETNAME=\\net\

Note that there are no quotes around \\net\  .
