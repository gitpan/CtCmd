The ClearCase::CtCmd module requires Perl v5.6.1 or v5.8 or later.
The ClearCase::CtCmd module requires that ClearCase be installed:

Platform                    ClearCase Version
_________________________________________

Solaris 2.7, 2.8, 2.9         2002.05 or later
HP-UX 11.00, 11.11            2002.05 "  "
RH Linux 7.2, 7.3, 8.0, 9     2002.05 "  "
AIX 4.3.3, 5.1, 5.2           2002.05 "  "
Windows XP Pro                2002.05 "  "
Windows 2000                  2002.05 "  "
Windows NT 4.0                2002.05 "  "



__________________________________________

Build and Install
__________________________________________

Build and installation is by the usual method:

perl Makefile.PL 
make
make test
make install


For verbose output when making test, set environment 
variable TEST_VERBOSE=1 and run "make -e test".

To install the module into non-default location, do 
perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/<your_home_directory>/. This 
may be useful for testing "make install".

Note:  The CC class is for test purposes only, although it
may be consulted for an indication of how ClearCase::CtCmd may be used.

When the MVFS is not installed, e. g. with ClearCase LT, it is not possible
to "make test".  However, in most cases, passing directly from a 
successful "make" to "make install" will be satisfactory.

__________________________________________

Platform Notes
__________________________________________

UNIX/Linux:

Set environment variable ATRIA_ROOT to the  
ClearCase installation path if different from /usr/atria:  
Linked install: set ATRIA_ROOT to network path.

If /var/tmp is not available, set environment variable CC_CTCMD_TMP
to the path of an alternative directory.


Solaris:

CtCmd has used a Sun "interposing filter", implemented in libzuba.so, to tell
the runtime loader to load RPC functions from the correct library. However, 
interposing filters are broken on Solaris 5.8 and 5.9 by some recent (as of 
2005-03-31) Solaris  patches. See Sun defect 510560:  "ld.so.1 gets a little 
too enthusiastic with interposition". If CtCmd is broken by one of the patches, 
below, or one of the corresponding Solaris 2.8 patches, it may be possible to 
set environment variable LD_PRELOAD to /usr/ucblib/librpcsoc.so to run CtCmd.

Note that CtCmd functions normally with certain Solaris 5.9 patches:
112963-07   work
112963-09   work
112963-12   work
112963-13   doesn't work
112963-14   doesn't work
112963-17   work
112963-18   doesn't work
112963-19   doesn't work

If the wrong Perl interpreter or C compiler is found, please do
ln -s <path to Perl> perl; ln -s <path to cc> cc,
or add the paths to those programs to PATH.

If using Solaris 5.8 /usr/bin/perl and trying to build the Module with gcc,
Set environment variable CC_CTCMD_GCC=<any non null value>.  This might work
with other Solaris Perls/gcc, as well. 

AIX:

The only way to run CtCmd with Perl 5.8.6 is to rebuild Perl 5.8.6 with 
the library link order changed to have -lc before -lnsl.

Win32:

Substitute "nmake" for "make" when building and installing.

There must be an environment variable: 
TMP=<path to system temporary storage, full control by everyone>.

The path to Microsoft Visual Studio and to Perl must be in the PATH.

The user must be able to run "Perl", "cleartool", "cl" and "dumpbin"
from the command line without error messages before attempting
installation.  The environment variables "inc" and "lib" must be set to
the paths where the MS Visual Studio C include files and libraries are
kept.  The user's PATH must include the path to the MSDEV ...\common\bin
and ...\bin directories, as well as the path to cleartool and the Clearcase 
*.dll's.  Perl, version 5.6.1 or greater must be installed, and the
installed Perl must have the necessary header and other files to allow
installation of a Perl Module. 

If cmdsyn.lib or ks.lib is not being created it may be because the path to
"dumpbin" or the path to the Clearcase libraries is not in the user's PATH.

An error message "This shared resource does not exist" at the beginning 
of t/t1_createArch when nmaking test indicates that a view previously mapped
then unmapped is inaccessible.  Pressing <enter> should allow the test
to continue.

Setting AUTODEF_DEBUG=<any non null value> will produce debugging output to 
assist in determining if ks.lib and cmdsyn.lib are being produced correctly.

In case of "nmake test" failure to create test view: 
"System error 67 - The network name cannot be found":

If the default view net name, "view", has been set to some other value with registry key 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE:SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Mvfs\Parameters\view_netname, 
set environment variable CC_VIEW_NETNAME=\\<view net name>\ before running 
"nmake test", or running the tests in the t directory explicitly. For example,

set CC_VIEW_NETNAME=\\net\

Note that there are no quotes around \\net\  .
