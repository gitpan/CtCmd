1.10  Fix for a crash in free() on unix systems using Perl 5.8.6 and later.
      Updated Makefile.PL to deal with new ClearCase library dependencies that 
      were added in ClearCase releases 7.1.2.9 and 8.0.0.5.
1.09  Added a version() subroutine to CtCmd that produces output similar to
      cleartool -verall. This insures that all of the ClearCase core libraries
      will be dynamically loaded when CtCmd is dynamically loaded. Fixed 
      handling of the temporary directory setting in the CC.pm module on 
      Windows. Fixes to the mkfolder and mkstream tests in t1_createArch.t.
      Also this version is included by default in the 8.0 release of 
      ClearCase.
1.08  Added support for AIX 6.x
      This change affects building CtCmd on AIX platforms only.  Changes to
      IBM Rational ClearCase versions 7.0.x and 7.1.x require updating the
      LDDLFLAGS so that CtCmd can be built using /usr/bin/perl on AIX 6.x
1.07  Improved Makefile construction on RHEL5 platform.
      This change affects building CtCmd on RHEL platforms only.  An update
      to /usr/bin/perl requires a change in order to support both RHEL4 and
      RHEL5.  Note that this update also removes -latriatirpc from the 
      library list; MCK is not being updated any more and users can still use 
      CtCmd 1.06 or edit Makefile.PL to restore it.
1.06  Due to changes in release 7 (Baltic) librpcsoc.so is no longer used.
      This change affects only Solaris implementations of CtCmd as 
      librpcsoc.so was only used for Solaris.  This means that release 7
      does not need the aux_zuba.c and the SolarisInterposer code.  Because
      we need backward compatibility that code needs to stay in
      for now.  When releases before release 7 are no longer supported, that
      code and all references to it may be removed.
1.04  Corrected compile warnings generated from aux_zuba.c and proc_table.h.
      License upgraded to CPL v1.0.  On Windows, CtCmd.dll links to ClearCase 
      dlls via symbol names instead of ordinal. So a patch of Clearcase
      will not necessarily require a rebuild of CtCmd. On Solaris, modified 
      aux_zuba.c to fix db_server:RPC failure introduced in ClearCase 2003.06 
      patch 12/13. Some clean up for HP-UX (HP-UX 10.20 no longer supported). 
1.03  Add vob.conf. Expand supported platforms to include Solaris
      2.9, Windows 5.1, HP-UX 11.11.  Modify signal behavior for
      ClearCase > 5.0. Added class method cmdstat() to return error
      status in scalar context.  
1.02  Modify ld in  SolarisInterposer.  Expand Windows $os test. 
      Add sections to README.  Add ChangeLog.
1.01  Fixed outfunc,errfunc.
1.00  Initial release to CPAN.
